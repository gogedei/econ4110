## 1. How has COVID affected the health of the retail industry, as measured by employment?

  To figure out how covid affected the health of the retail industry as measured by unemployment I regressed three variables across the relevant timeline. The variables include the labor force rate, unemployment rate, and COVID unemployment rate. The start date is 03/01/2019, and the end date is 04/01/2022.  The regression of the labor force rate across time gives us a picture of available labor throughout the pandemic which is important to the retail industry because it shows what labor resources were available to the industry. The unemployment rate and covid unemployment rate describe the proportion of workers in the labor force that are not working. The corresponding graphs illustrate the sharp spike in unemployment starting in early 2020 that results from the prevalence of COVID. With regards to unemployment, the retail industry experienced severe trauma through the start of COVID. By January 2021 the unemployment rate had almost returned to its pre-COVID level of around 4%, but due to another rise in COVID unemployment increased for a relatively short period before resuming its decline after the winter months. By this point covid was still prevalent, but society had started to adapt to the new circumstances allowing for a less intense spike than in 2020. Over the measured time period (03/01/20 - 04/01/22) COVID had an enormous negative impact on the health of the retail industry regarding unemployment. 

## 2. How has retail fared relative to other industries?


```{r}

#Retail Trade vs Arts/Entertainment Industry Regression

retent <- big %>%
  filter(indname %in% c('Retail Trade','Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation, and Accommodation and Food Services')) %>%
  mutate(unemployed = 1*(EMPSTAT %in% 20:22),
         date = ym(paste0(YEAR, MONTH))) %>%
  filter(date > ym(paste0('2020', '04'))) %>%
           mutate(indname = factor(indname, levels =rev(c('Retail Trade','Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation, and Accommodation and Food Services'))),
                  date = as.numeric(date)/30)

ret1 <- feols(unemployed~date*indname, data=retent)

export_summs(ret1, model.names = 'Retail Trade vs Arts/Entertainment',number_format = "%.4f")

```
  In order to establish competitive benchmarks, we utilized U.S unemployment statistics from the Current Population Survey. These benchmarks allow us to compare the relative performance of similar industries during the pandemic to that of our own retail industry. Regression analysis was performed with unemployment regressed against date and an interaction term for that of the industry type. The Arts/ Entertainment Industry and Wholesale Trade were selected as industries due to their organizational similarities to that of the retail trade industry. These similarities would aid in establishing a comparable benchmark. Both interaction coefficients were statistically significant at an alpha value of 0.001 leaving both to hold statistically significant differences in unemployment rates. In the regression of Retail Trade vs Arts/Entertainment Industry we witness an interaction term coefficient of 0.0060 which indicates that Retail trade industry has a statistically significant higher rate of unemployment. Whilst the Retail Trade vs Wholesale trade regression yielded an interaction coefficient of –0.0008 which indicates that Retail trade has a statistically significant, lower rate of unemployment. These considerations were made with the assumption that the industries were facing similar conditions to be worthy of a comparable benchmark. The data set also presented its own definition of officially recognized industries and unemployment definitions that could greatly vary from source to source. There is also the limitation of utilizing public unemployment records that don’t necessarily represent the health of an entire industry as some firms may be moving towards capital-based labor or vice versa with manual labor. Overall, we can see that when considering the rate of unemployment over time for retail trade it seems to be lagging behind than that of the Arts/Entertainment industry over time but is faring better off than that of the Wholesale trade industry over time.  

```{r}

#Retail Trade vs Wholesale Trade Regression

retwho <- big %>%
  filter(indname %in% c('Retail Trade','Wholesale Trade')) %>%
  mutate(unemployed = 1*(EMPSTAT %in% 20:22),
         date = ym(paste0(YEAR, MONTH))) %>%
  filter(date > ym(paste0('2020', '04'))) %>%
  mutate(indname = factor(indname, levels =rev(c('Retail Trade','Wholesale Trade'))),
         date = as.numeric(date)/30)

ret2 <- feols(unemployed~date*indname, data=retwho)

export_summs(ret2, model.names ='Retail Trade vs Wholesale Trade', number_format = "%.4f")

```

## 3. Retail needs to worry about who has money to spend - what has changed about who is working and earning money?

```{r}

#Family Income vs Time (date) Regression

famincome <- big %>%
  mutate(date = ym(paste0(YEAR, MONTH))) %>%
  filter(date > ym(paste0('2020', '04'))) %>%
  mutate(date = as.numeric(date)/30)

famreg <- feols(FAMINC~date, data = famincome)

export_summs(famreg, model.names = 'Family Income vs Time', number_format = "%.4f")
         
```

  To see the change in who is working and earning money since COVID-19 in April 2020, we regressed the family income variable across the date variable which covers the relevant timeline. The family income variable is the total income of all persons related to the head of the household who are 15 years or older. Income consists of money from jobs, net income from a business, farm/rent, pensions, dividends, interest, and Social Security payments. The date variable starts in April 2020 and is in monthly increments. Changes in the family income variable would show the change in who is working and earning money since any changes in a person’s earnings would be reflected in their family income. By regressing family income throughout our timeline, we are able to see if families are earning more or less money since COVID-19. Our results show that every one-unit increase in month since April 2020 is associated with a –0.0875 unit decrease in family income. Since job income is included in our family income variable, we can also assume that a decrease in family income can be associated with fewer working family members. In the context of our data, this is quite plausible since a lot of people lost their jobs with the onset of COVID-19 so there would be a change in who is working and earning when calculating the total family income. Over the measured time period of April 2020 to April 2022, family members are working less and earning less money.
